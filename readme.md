A cake cutting solution
==========================

This was originally a solution to a work application pre-assignment.
This an improvement on my first solution, which was pretty slow : ). 
Before this, I had never really had any experience in optimizing
performance so I was really learning the hard way. Maybe this 
demonstrates something, I hope.

The assignment was to cut a rectangular cake with randomly placed
ornamental flowers into pieces all containing a single flower.
