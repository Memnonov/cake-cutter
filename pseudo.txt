- find flowers in area (hold on to found flowers)		
- if only 1 flower, save as a piece		
		
- Split in half		
- try to find at least one flower in both areas		
		
- If both halves contain flowers		
		--> OK, split and process splits again
		
- If any half contains 0 flowers		
		--> split from last flower in cut direction
		if OK → process halves normally
		    BAD → process whole area from other direction
